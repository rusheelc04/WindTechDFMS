This diagram illustrates the flow of data through the Drone Fleet Management System, including:

#### External Entities:

- **Customers/Stakeholders:** Provide order details and receive status updates and reports.
- **Drone Operators:** Operate drones, handle safety protocols, and receive training.
- **Suppliers:** Provide inventory data and updates.
- **Admin:** Manage processes, perform inspections, and generate reports.
- **Technicians:** Maintain drones, analyze data, and perform inspections.

#### Processes:

- **Schedule Maintenance & Service:** Schedule drone maintenance using data from the Maintenance Database.
- **Provide Training:** Train drone operators to comply with safety protocols.
- **Implement Safety Protocols:** Ensure safety measures are implemented and followed.
- **Ensure Security:** Manage security measures for drone operations.
