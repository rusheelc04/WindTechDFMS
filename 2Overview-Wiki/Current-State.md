## Key Issues
The maintenance of wind turbines at WindTech Innovations currently relies on manual inspections and repairs, which take up a lot of time and pose safety risks to human technicians. This manual labor leads to inefficiencies in scheduling, delays in issue detection, and increased operational downtime and maintenance costs. This approach is not sustainable given the harsh environments and the high altitude at which technicians must operate, exacerbating the risk of accidents and reducing overall operational efficiency. Manual inspections by humans also don't always capture comprehensive data impacting the ability to perform predictive and analytical maintenance and optimize turbine performance. This inefficiency and safety concern are the key forefront issues our Drone Fleet Management System aims to solve by automating these processes and utilizing advanced databases and drone technology for inspections and maintenance tasks.

## Impact
The reliance on manual processes for wind turbine maintenance has several negative consequences:

- **High Costs**: Manual inspections and repairs are labor-intensive and costly due to the long hours and the high salaries paid for high-risk tasks.
- **Safety Risks**: Technicians working at high altitudes face safety risks, from falls to mechanical failure resulting in injury. These risks threaten employees but also increase the company’s liability and insurance costs.
- **Downtime**: The time-consuming nature of manual inspections leads to longer downtimes for turbines, reducing the overall efficiency of energy production. Furthermore, coordinating maintenance times considering weather and wind forecasts can be a daunting task for humans.
- **Suboptimal Maintenance Decisions**: Little data collection and analytical capabilities negatively impact decision-making, preventing the use of predictive maintenance strategies that can address potential failures and optimize turbine performance.
- **Environmental Impact**: Manual activities contribute to a higher carbon footprint

## Context
The issues with manual wind turbine maintenance mainly occur during routine checks and unforeseen repairs across WindTech Innovations’ global operations, particularly in remote or difficult-to-access locations. The need for manual intervention becomes more challenging and risky due to environmental factors and varied climate conditions where these turbines are installed. This situation is further complicated by the growing scale of installations and evolving safety and environmental regulations.

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders affected by the problem of manual wind turbine maintenance include:

- **Maintenance Technicians**: Directly impacted as they face high safety risks and demanding work conditions.
- **Operations Managers**: Responsible for the efficiency and safety of maintenance operations.
- **IT Analysts**: Involved in integrating and maintaining operational systems that support turbine maintenance.
- **Safety Officers**: Ensure that maintenance practices comply with safety standards.
- **Environmental Analysts**: They focus on minimizing the environmental impact of maintenance activities.
- **WindTech Innovations**: Overall, the company faces increased operational costs, potential regulatory issues, and challenges in meeting sustainability goals.
- **Customers and Energy Consumers**: Indirectly affected through potential disruptions in energy supply and the sustainability of energy production.

## Solution
These issues need to be solved and implementing the Drone Fleet Management System will tackle inefficiencies and risks of manual maintenance and improve the precision of maintenance activities. It will also align with strategic goals to promote sustainable practices and compliance with evolving environmental regulations.
