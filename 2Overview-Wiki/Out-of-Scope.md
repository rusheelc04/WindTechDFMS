#Out of Scope:
Activities and deliverables out of scope include:
- **Direct Repair Operations:** The DFMS will not conduct physical repairs on wind turbines; it is designed to facilitate inspections and data collection only.
- **In-Depth Data Analysis:** While the DFMS will gather and organize data, it will not replace the need for expert analysis by human technicians and analysts.
- **Full Autonomy in Decision-Making:** DFMS will support decision-making but will not be the final decision-maker on maintenance actions, which will still require human oversight.
- **Non-Maintenance Related Drone Usage:** The system will not support drone usage for purposes other than maintenance inspections, such as surveillance or delivery services.
- **Extensive Customization for Each Wind Farm:** The system will offer a range of configurable features, but it will not be custom-built for the specific nuances of each individual wind farm.
