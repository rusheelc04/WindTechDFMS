| Maintenance Scheduling and Optimization Tool |                    | ✓                    |                       |
| Predictive Maintenance Algorithms            |                    |                      | ✓                     |
| Goals                                        | Deploy initial system capabilities for real-time monitoring and control to enhance maintenance efficiency, aligning with OKR 1 and OKR 2 by improving repair time and reducing manned repairs. | Enhance system integration and user interface for better usability, expanding functionality to support predictive maintenance setups, directly supporting OKR 3 by integrating advanced analytics. | Implement advanced predictive maintenance to optimize operational efficiency, fulfilling OKR 3 by reducing unplanned maintenance and OKR 4 by enhancing stakeholder satisfaction through improved maintenance outcomes. |
| Success Metrics                              | System deployment on schedule with less than 2 critical bugs; initial user feedback score greater than 3.5/5. | 25% increased system usage; 20% improvement in user feedback. | 15% reduction in maintenance costs; 10% decrease in turbine downtime. |
| Supporting Tasks | Stakeholder onboarding, initial training sessions, system integration testing. | User interface improvements, additional training for enhanced features. |  Finalize and test predictive maintenance features, collect comprehensive user feedback. |
| Rationale | The MVP focuses on essential real-time data and control features to start providing value and gathering user feedback immediately. This stage sets the groundwork for more complex integrations. | Enhancements aim to refine user interaction and expand functionality, based on initial feedback and observed usage patterns. This phase strengthens the foundation laid by the MVP. | Version 1.1 leverages data analytics for predictive maintenance, optimizing operational efficiency and further reducing costs. This stage maximizes the system’s value by fully integrating advanced analytics. |

## Approach to Prioritization

Our prioritization approach was guided by the following principles:

1. **Immediate Value and Feedback**: Target core functionalities that provide immediate benefits and allow for the collection of user feedback, crucial for iterative development.
2. **Stakeholder Needs and Business Goals**: Prioritize features that directly support key stakeholder needs and business objectives, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and stakeholder satisfaction.
3. **Technical Feasibility and Resource Availability**: Ensure realistic planning and deployment through careful consideration of available resources and technical capabilities.
4. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Design each release to deliver tangible benefits, building on the capabilities of the previous versions to progressively enhance value.
