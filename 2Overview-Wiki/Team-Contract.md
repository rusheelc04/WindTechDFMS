**GOALS, EXPECTATIONS, STRATEGIES, RULES & CONSEQUENCES:**

**What are our groupâ€™s goals for how we accomplish our work?**

We want to make sure that work gets completed in a timely manner. Ensuring that whenever the due dates are, we exceed them by completing work beforehand. We will do this by:

1. Starting early. It takes communication and teamwork to make sure we are able to be on the same page, and work on assignments early.
2. If teammates are lost, we will not be afraid to ask questions and voice our concerns

**EXPECTATIONS: What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.? Include contact information and preferred method(s) of communication.**

If we know we are unable to make a certain day in class, or miss a quiz section, we will ensure to inform our teammates ahead of time by at least 48 hours in advance. This way, we are holding each other accountable, along with those who miss certain days/lectures. Say if a teammate misses a class we must:

1. Make up the work we missed so our teammates do not feel burdened by the work
2. Text our teammates immediately to make sure everyone is on the same page
3. Active Participation in Meetings: We expect each team member to actively participate in meetings by contributing ideas, offering feedback, and engaging in discussions. This ensures that everyone's perspectives are heard and valued.
4. Timely Completion of Assigned Tasks. Each team member is responsible for completing their assigned tasks by the agreed-upon deadlines (which we assign before the start of every week). If there are any challenges or delays, it is expected that they communicate this immediately to the team to strategize solutions.
5. Open and Honest Communication. We value transparency and honesty in our team's communication. If there are any concerns, conflicts, or obstacles stopping our progress, team members are expected to communicate them openly and work together to resolve them constructively.
6. Professionalism.We expect all team members to maintain a professional demeanor and treat each other with respect at all times. This includes being punctual for meetings, actively listening to others' viewpoints, and refraining from any behavior that may be considered disrespectful or disruptive.
7. Moving forward, we expect to communicate via discord channel at least 3 times a week outside of class, to communicate work and delegate different roles and communication. If needed we will schedule a discord voice call so we communicate easily.



**STRATEGIES: What strategies can we employ to promote systems thinking, a suspension of assumptions, viewing one another as colleagues, and developing facilitation skills by all team members? What methods of giving and receiving feedback will best support us?**

1. Regular Check-Ins: Conduct regular check-ins or team meetings where team members can openly discuss ideas, share perspectives, and provide updates on their projects. This creates opportunities for feedback and encourages open communication.
2. Peer Review and Critique: Implement peer review and critique sessions where team members provide constructive feedback on each other's work. This encourages continuous improvement and helps team members refine their ideas and approaches.
Regular Brainstorming Sessions: Organize regular brainstorming sessions where team members collectively explore solutions to current problems we are trying to solve. 


**TEAM RULES: What rules can we agree on to** 

1. Regular Brainstorming Sessions: Organize regular brainstorming sessions where team members collectively explore solutions to current problems we are trying to solve. 

2. Project Completion Deadline: All team members must strive to complete their assigned tasks at least one day before the project deadline. This allows time for review, editing, and any unforeseen issues.
3. Communication During Emergencies: If a team member encounters a scheduling emergency or is unable to complete their task due to unforeseen circumstances, they must immediately inform the team via our communication platform : Discord.
4. Attendance and Contribution to Meetings: Team members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings. If unable to attend, they must notify the team in advance and try to contribute their portion of the work or provide input asynchronously.
5. Proactive Communication: If a team member anticipates potential obstacles or delays in completing their tasks, they should communicate this promptly to the team, along with any proposed solutions or adjustments to the plan.
Respectful and Constructive Feedback: All feedback provided within the team should be respectful, constructive, and aimed at improving the quality of our work. Critiques should be focused on the task at hand, not on personal characteristics.
6. Accountability and Ownership: Each team member is accountable for their assigned tasks and responsibilities. If a team member commits to completing a task, they are expected to follow through and deliver results.
7. Continuous Improvement: We will regularly review and reflect on our team's performance, processes, and communication to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary changes.

**CONSEQUENCES: How will we address non-performance in regard to these goals, expectations, policies, and procedures?** 

First thing before a warning is placed, we will address our teammates to ensure we can support them to our highest capacity. By having a discussion first as a group we can try and kneed out the knots in any issues beforehand. If that is unable to resolve it we will move forward with the process. 

If a team member does not communicate their absences or knows they will not be able to make up their portion of work, we will address this by using the team warning and removal process.

First, we will issue a warning: We currently have a group of 4, meaning to issue a warning requires 2 out of the 3 remaining members. 

Next, we will issue the warning out to the professor: She will keep it and also inform the team member that it was issued. The warning is meant to help get our team back on track and to not cause tension. 

Another scenario would be if a team member is underperforming in the group which would result in another conversation. If quality of work were to not change, then a meeting with the TA would be required in order to resolve this issue. 

**WORST SCENARIO:** If the team member with the current warnings still does not seem deemable to the remaining team, we will issue a petition to get that member removed to the professor. 


We share these goals and expectations and agree to these policies, procedures, and consequences.
