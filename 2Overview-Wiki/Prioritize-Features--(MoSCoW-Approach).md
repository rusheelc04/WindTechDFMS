In developing the Drone Fleet Management System, it's crucial to prioritize key functionalities aligned with stakeholder needs. Through research, we've identified six essential features. Using the MoSCoW rule, we'll prioritize these features to ensure our development efforts deliver maximum value.

1. **Self Navigating Drones:**
   - Must Have: This feature is critical for reducing manual inspections, enhancing productivity, and detecting issues early, aligning with organizational efficiency goals and stakeholder expectations. The self-navigating drones significantly reduce the time and costs associated with manual inspections, leading to improved efficiency and potentially extending the lifespan of wind turbines through early issue detection.
   
2. **Automated Damage Detection:**
   - Must Have: Early detection of damage is crucial for preventive maintenance and ensuring turbine reliability, supporting energy production targets and stakeholder confidence. This feature allows for the easy identification of potential issues, minimizing turbine downtime and ensuring continued energy production.
   
3. **Real-Time Data Analysis:**
   - Should Have: Real-time monitoring and analysis are vital for proactive maintenance and informed decision-making, facilitating operational efficiency and stakeholder satisfaction. This feature may not be as critical as automated damage detection for immediate preventive action but is essential for optimizing maintenance strategies and enhancing overall operational efficiency.
   
4. **Centralized Drone Control Dashboard:**
   - Could Have: A centralized dashboard is essential for efficient drone management, providing operational oversight and facilitating real-time adjustments to enhance workflow and efficiency. However, the implementation may be deferred initially in favor of features directly related to drone functionality and data analysis.
   
5. **Automated Data Integration System:**
   - Should Have: Automated data integration is critical for streamlining data management and ensuring consistent access to actionable insights, supporting maintenance optimization and environmental impact assessments. While not as immediate as the detection features, this capability is crucial for long-term data-driven maintenance strategies and compliance reporting.
   
6) **Maintenance Scheduling and Optimization Tool:**
   - Could Have: A scheduling and optimization tool is essential for maximizing turbine uptime and ensuring efficient maintenance scheduling, aligning with organizational goals and end-user needs. However, the implementation may be deferred initially to focus on features directly related to drone functionality and data analysis, with further optimization introduced iteratively based on user feedback and system performance evaluations.
