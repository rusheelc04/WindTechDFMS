# **Problem Statement:**

Efficiency and safety in wind turbine maintenance are currently compromised by the reliance on manual inspections, which are slow, costly, and hazardous for technicians who must climb turbines. This outdated approach results in delayed issue detection, unnecessary downtime, and increased risk to maintenance staff, especially during routine and emergency operations across our wind farms.

The introduction of drone technology for detailed inspections and data collection is imperative. However, to fully harness the capabilities of such technology and enhance operational efficiency, there is a vital need to develop a sophisticated information system. This system will manage a fleet of drones dedicated to the maintenance of wind turbines, enabling real-time data analysis, centralized drone control, automated data integration, predictive maintenance scheduling, and enhanced safety protocols.

By adopting this advanced system, we can expedite the inspection process, reduce manual labor risks, and lower maintenance costs. This transition from reactive to proactive maintenance will not only improve the safety and efficiency of turbine operations but also ensure a significant increase in the longevity and performance of our energy assets. This initiative will ultimately optimize our maintenance workflows, increase technician safety, and enhance the sustainability of our operations.
