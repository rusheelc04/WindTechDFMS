**Security Needs**

- **Data Protection**: Data within the system will be protected through encryption protocols and access controls. Encryption will ensure that sensitive information remains secure both during transmission and storage. Access controls will restrict data access to authorized users only, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
  
- **User Authentication**: Users will be authenticated through a multi-factor authentication process, requiring them to provide multiple forms of verification, such as passwords, biometrics, or security tokens. This enhances the security of user accounts by adding additional layers of protection beyond just passwords.
  
- **Security Roles**: Specific security roles will be defined within the system to regulate access and permissions based on user responsibilities and privileges. These roles may include administrators, managers, analysts, and regular users, each with varying levels of access to system functionalities and data.
  
- **Compliance with Industry Best Practices**: Security measures implemented in the system will comply with industry best practices, such as those outlined by standards organizations like NIST and ISO. Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively, ensuring ongoing adherence to industry standards and protection against potential threats.

**Scalability Needs**

- **Expected User Growth**: The system is expected to cater to a growing user base, with projections indicating a 20% increase in users annually over the next five years. This growth is attributed to the expansion of WindTech's operations and the adoption of the DFMS across multiple geographic regions.
  
- **Data Volume Expansion**: Data volumes are anticipated to grow proportionally with the increase in users, with a projected 30% annual growth in data generated by drone operations and turbine maintenance activities. This includes both real-time data from ongoing operations and historical data retained for compliance and analysis purposes.

**Availability Needs**

- **Uptime Percentage**: The system is required to maintain a minimum uptime percentage of 99.9% to ensure continuous availability and uninterrupted access for users. This high level of availability is crucial for supporting WindTech's operational workflows and minimizing disruptions to turbine maintenance activities.
  
- **Maximum Recovery Time**: In the event of system unavailability, the maximum allowable recovery time is set at four hours. This ensures that any system downtime is promptly addressed, limiting the impact on operational efficiency and user productivity.

**Interoperability Needs**

- **System Integration**: The DFMS needs to communicate with other systems, such as WindTech's existing data management platforms and third-party analytics tools. Data exchanges between systems will include turbine inspection data, maintenance logs, and operational performance metrics.

**Sustainability Goals and Needs**

- **Power Consumption Limits**: The system is required to adhere to maximum power consumption limits to minimize environmental impact and optimize energy efficiency. This includes implementing energy-efficient hardware components and optimizing software algorithms to reduce resource consumption.

**Standards and Compliance Needs**

- **Regulatory Compliance**: The system must comply with relevant industry regulations and standards, including accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0), data privacy laws (GDPR), and organizational policies (FERPA). Compliance with these standards ensures data security, privacy protection, and ethical data handling practices.
